The messaging app that I have created allows users to send messages and share photos between two users.
The app utilizes Firebase as the backend service for sending messages and photos in real-time.
Firebase provides a reliable and scalable infrastructure to handle message delivery and synchronization between devices.
To enhance the user experience and enable offline access to messages, the app also integrates the Room library, 
which is a local database solution provided by Android. Room allows the app to store messages locally on the device,
enabling users to access their messages even when they are offline or experiencing connectivity issues.
This ensures that users can continue their conversations seamlessly, regardless of their network status.
