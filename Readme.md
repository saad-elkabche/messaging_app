<h1>About the App:</h1>
The messaging app that I have created allows users to send messages and share photos between two users. The app enables real-time communication and facilitates seamless conversation between users. 

<h1>Technologies:</h1>
The app is built using Firebase as the backend service for message delivery and photo sharing. Firebase provides a reliable and scalable infrastructure for real-time communication, ensuring that messages are delivered instantly and reliably between users. It also offers features such as authentication and data storage, which are utilized to enhance the app's functionality.

In addition to Firebase, the app incorporates the Room library for local message storage. Room is an Android library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite, enabling efficient local storage and retrieval of messages. By leveraging Room, the app can store messages locally on the device, allowing users to access their messages even when they are offline or experiencing connectivity issues.
